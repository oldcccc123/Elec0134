Task B. Multiclass task
Build a classifier to identify the type of tumor in each MRI image (meningioma tumor, glioma tumor, pituitary tumor or no tumor). 

o The role of each file. 
Task A has two files. One uses logistic regression and the other uses K-NN model.
Task B has one file. 
The data has been pre-processed into 4 classes by file classification files.ipynb.
The data used in training for task A is in task A folder.
The data used in training for task B is in task B folder.
The data used in testing for task A is in task A folder.
The data used in testing for task B is in task B folder.

o How to run your code. 
The file should be placed within same folder as dataset to avoid path error.

o Necessary packages or header files (e.g. numpy, scipy, etc.). 
matplotlib.pyplot
numpy
torchvision
sklearn
